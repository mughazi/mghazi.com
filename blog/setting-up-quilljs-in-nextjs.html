    <h1>Setting up Quill editor in Next.js</h1>

    <p>
      I've tried a few javascript rich text editors and I like Quill the most.
      With my default framework being Next.js, I'd like to share how I'm setting
      it up here. Because I found it a bit confusing to find the right
      information on how to do it. The official Quill documentation is nice but
      its written in vanilla JavaScript instead of TypeScript. I'm using Next.js
      15.
    </p>

    <p>
      Disclaimer: It might be easier for you just to use quill-react. But I like
      using the library directly without a wrapper. That way I can use the
      latest and greatest version.
    </p>

    <p>First, install the Quill package.</p>

    <pre>npm install quill</pre>

    <p>
      Then create a new file called quill.tsx and copy/paste the following code.
    </p>

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/mughazi/d90f04d4679c1d43400d2c57e7d10ae8.js"></script>

    <p>Next create another component which imports the quill component.</p>
    <p>I saved this inside a file called quill.editor.tsx.</p>
    <p>
      Note that I'm importing the component dynamically to prevent 'document not
      found' error, and also to prevent the component from being rendered on the
      server side.
    </p>

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/mughazi/fe81b6b014fdd3ac47a15476f0427ff9.js"></script>

    <p>
      And that's pretty much it. You can now use the component in your page like
      so.
